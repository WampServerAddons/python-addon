Current bugs in the installer

* pywin32 has gui executable. see if there is a zip version

* no mod_wsgi support or mod_python support

* the installer for mod_python will not install without copying a file to the same directory as the exe - http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/4496

* official mod_python releases are only support python 2.5 and mod_wsgi will not support that version of python. either an unofficial release of one of these will have to be used, or only one can be installed at a time.

mod_python:	http://www.modpython.org/
mod_wsgi:	http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/

* mod_python download locations vary by version.

* possibly test with portablepython or movable python

* Code scraps for mod_wsgi/mod_python
